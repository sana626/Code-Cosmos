Tower defence game 

This project is a statergey based tower defence game where players have to defend against an alien attack. Users can place a variety of turrets to protect their spaceship, and in turn win the level. I used JavaScript as the backend language due to it's great usability for website games, as well as HTML and CSS to create a stylized GUI. 

Key features:
- Collision detection between the aliens and the turrets
- ( future) An AI-powered enemy that uses A* algorithm to detect the quickest path to the end
- (future) Varying towers and aliens with abilities that scale in difficulty
- (furture) Menu and startup pages
