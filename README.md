Tower defence game 

This project is a statergey based tower defence game where players have to defend against an alien attack. Users can place a variety of turrets to protect their spaceship, and in turn win the level. I used JavaScript as the backend language due to it's great usability for website games, as well as HTML and CSS to create a stylized GUI. 

Key features:
- A space themed splash screen and aethetics
- Collision detection between the aliens and the turrets
- Combat syste between the aliens and the tower
- Energy collection systems and tower purchasing system
